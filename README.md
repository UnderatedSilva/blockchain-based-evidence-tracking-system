# 🔍 Forensic Chain: Blockchain-Based Evidence Tracking System

> **Securing Forensic Integrity & Immutable Chain of Custody**

This project is a decentralized web application designed to maintain a transparent, tamper-proof, and verifiable record of digital evidence. By combining **Ethereum Smart Contracts**, **IPFS**, and **SHA-256 Hashing**, it ensures that forensic evidence remains admissible in court by preventing unauthorized modifications and manual logging errors.

## ✨ Key Features

* **✅ Immutable Chain of Custody:** Every upload, transfer, and access event is permanently recorded on the Ethereum blockchain.


* **✅ Cryptographic Integrity Verification:** Uses **SHA-256** to create a unique digital fingerprint for every file. The system automatically detects if even a single bit of evidence has been altered.


* **✅ Decentralized Storage:** Actual evidence files are stored on **IPFS** (InterPlanetary File System), ensuring high availability and resilience against single points of failure.


* **✅ Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Distinct permissions for **Administrators**, **Forensic Investigators**, and **Auditors**.


* **✅ Automated Audit Trails:** Generates comprehensive, timestamped logs for forensic reporting and legal admissibility.

## 🏃 Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites

* **Node.js** installed
* **MetaMask** browser extension
* **Ganache** (for local blockchain testing) 



### 2. Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/forensic-chain.git

# Enter the directory
cd forensic-chain

# Install dependencies
npm install

```

### 3. Setup Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```text
VITE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=your_smart_contract_address
VITE_PINATA_JWT=your_ipfs_gateway_token

```

### 4. Run the App

```bash
npm run dev

```

## 📂 System Architecture

The system uses a layered architecture to separate concerns and maximize security:

1. **Application Layer:** React.js frontend for investigator interaction.


2. **Logic Layer:** Node.js/Web3.js for hashing and IPFS coordination.


3. **Blockchain Layer:** Solidity Smart Contracts for immutable record keeping.


4. **Storage Layer:** IPFS for secure, decentralized file retention.
